easily make it works just downloading it and then opening the cmd and executing ng serve.\nThe app will be served at port 4200.\nContent of the pages\nProjects\nHome\nAll projects created are displayed. You can access to the executions of a concrete project or delete it. If you delete a project, all its executions will be deleted too.\n\nCreate project\nA new project can be created and the user must provide at least one execution (.txt file and its surefire report as .xml file).\n\nExecution of project\nHome\nFor a target project, this page displays all its executions.\n\nLogs of execution\nHome (simple visualization)\nThe user just has to select a view mode\n\nComparison mode\nWhen the user selects an execution to compare with and select a comparison mode, the layout changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
